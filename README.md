# William Spencer CV

## Career Summary
After 4 years of Sales Operation roles within the travel industry, due to COVID 19 the company closed its London operation and I was made redundant. I always had an interest in coding and used this opportunity to invest my savings and enrol onto a 3 month boot camp coding course, in order to become a Front End Developer.

My objective was to gain a more technical knowledge of developing and improving software, building on previous work experience developing internal systems in customer facing organisations. I am an organised and clear communicator, with the ability to understand business operations and design and implement improved systems together with the ability, and personality, to manage their roll-out effectively and gain acceptance within the organisation.
